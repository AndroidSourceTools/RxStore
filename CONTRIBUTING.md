Contributing
============

If you would like to contribute code to RxStore you can do so through GitHub by
forking the repository and sending a pull request.

When submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions
and style in order to keep the code as readable as possible. If you are using
IntelliJ or Android Studio, you can make use of [Square's code styles](https://github.com/square/java-code-styles).
