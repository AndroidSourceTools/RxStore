G-Rex
=====

A tiny library that assists in saving and restoring objects to and from disk using RxJava on Android.

Details
-------

There are [many options][1] for persisting data in Android, some easier than others.

* Simple key/value pair? [SharedPreferences][2] makes that simple.
* Elaborate and enormous data sets? [SQLite][3] can help you, if that's your kind of thing...
* Everything else? We just want to put and get objects from disk with minimal overhead.

G-Rex is here to help. It's not doing anything fancy; it's probably code you've written many times yourself. It just wants to help you with a task that can be tedious, allowing you to get on coding the fun stuff.

G-Rex is most useful to those already using [Gson][4]/[Jackson][8] and [RxJava][5] in their applications. Gson/Jackson allow for simple serialization/deserialization of objects. RxJava helps alleviate threading concerns and allows for composition with existing method chains.

Usage
-----

Say we have a class called `Dino`

```java
public class Dino {
	public String name;
	public int armLength;
}
```

You can use a `GRexPersister` as a stand alone helper to store a Dino.

```java
GRexPersister persister = new GRexPersister(getContext(), "persistence", new GsonConverter());

Dino dino = new Dino("Gregory", 37);

persister.put("dinoKey", dino)
	.subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
	.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
	.subscribe(new Observer<Dino>() {
		@Override
		public void onNext(Dino dino) {
			//Hurrah, dino was persisted!
		}
	});
```

If you're an rxjava-android user, this code will look very familiar to you. The write operation will occur off the main thread, and we get informed of the completion back *on* the main thread.

You could also store a `List` of toothy friends
```java
List<Dino> dinos = getDinoList(); //Some method that returns an ArrayList of Dinos.

persister.putList("dinoListKey", dinos, Dino.class)
	.subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
	.observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThead())
	.subscribe(new Observer<List<Dino>>() {
		@Override
		public void onNext(List<Dino> dinos) {
			//Fear the stubby-armed army
		} 
	});
```

Are you using RxJava in conjunction with Square's [Retrofit][6]? You could download and persist data in one go.

```java
webServices.getDino()
    .flatMap(new Func1<Dino, Observable<Dino>>() {
        @Override
        public Observable<Dino> call(Dino dino) {
            return persister.put("dinoKey", dino);
        }
    })
    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
    .subscribe(new Observer<Dino>() {
        @Override
        public void onNext(Dino dino) {
            //Behold the downloaded and persisted dino
        }
    });
```

Converters
----------

G-Rex allows you to choose your own serialization format. [`GsonConverter`][9] and [`JacksonConverter`][10] are provided out of the box, but you're free to implement your own [`Converter`][11]. Pull requests for additional formats are also welcome.
